Problem: 
High wastage in food/medicine due to shelf-life mismanagement.

Solution:
Build a smart expiry management dashboard using simulated IoT inputs.
Use ML to:
-Predict spoilage
-Suggest discounts at right times
-Providing goods in combos
-Fridge failure, push those goods for quick sell
-Trigger intra-store movement before expiry
-Flagging of stores based on spoilage %
Mock setup: Use virtual sensors or APIs to simulate data like temperature, humidity, spoilage %.
